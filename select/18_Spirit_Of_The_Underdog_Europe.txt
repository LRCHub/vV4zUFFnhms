Seen you 'round, I know your face
Watched you try grow up with grace
Seen that heart out on your sleeve
Like it's so much life, you're dying to feel
You're dying to feel

'Cause if you got to steal
You've got to steel the show
It's the spirit of the underdog

And if you got to break
You've got to break the mold
It's the spirit of the underdog
(Underdog)

I've seen you reach that main event
And make it look like an accident
Your need for love can't be replaced
Just put away at least for today
At least for today

'Cause if you got to steal
You've got to steel the show
It's the spirit of the underdog

And if you got to break
You've got to break the mold
It's the spirit of the underdog

'Cause if you got to steal
You've got to steel the show
It's the spirit of the underdog

And if you got to break
You've got to break the mold
It's the spirit of the underdog
It's the spirit of the underdog
It's the spirit of the underdog
