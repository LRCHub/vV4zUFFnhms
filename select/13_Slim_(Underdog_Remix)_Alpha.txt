Helen White:
Step outside
And feel the warmth
Much stronger than inside
Crazy path
That lead you here
Creates a place to hide.
And I'm scared to be so heartless
I'm hoping that you'll learn
There's only one and that is you
And I'm scared to be so heartless
I'm hoping that you'll learn
There's only one and that is you
Frightened eyes take in the view
Forgetting how it feels
Look around, believe yourself

The world outside is real
And I'm scared to be so heartless
I'm hoping that you'll learn
There's only one and that is you
And I'm scared to be so heartless
I'm hoping that you'll learn
There's only one and that is you
Gave myself to you
No one can deny
I'm still waiting 'til you be
So content to feel
Can't despise myself
I'm still waiting 'til
Leave me break my heart
Can't control the pain
I'm still waiting 'til.
