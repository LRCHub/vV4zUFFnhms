We're the originals

I'm blacker than jack
I got ganja on my brain
We're the main picture in your fucking frame
We got no problem with you bigging up your status
Fuck Mickey J, the Brotherhood is the baddest
You thought we lost the plot
You shoulda backed some winners
You're dealing with some pros not the absolute beginners
Like Adam Ant just "Stand and Deliver"
Your best lines oh boy or retire

Aye, aye, aye, make your damply, samply, other champy
The Brotherhood would zig zag
And make the levels like Zool
Cool Hand Luke, Skywalk Talk
I be the last outlaw like Mickey Rourke, so Mork
Call in Orson, hit the floor, son
I rip the mic sure bloody like an abortion
Please have caution
We've got the 'words-all' like Gummidge
Stick 'em all together like the heads in rugby scrummage
You're dummage, you and emcee, Mr. Cabbage
Mess with the hoods and get the X from Mr. Babbage (uh-uh)
Better mind your Ps and Qs
When you rap with blacks and Jews, better know your don'ts and dos
Choose your words wisely, choose your words wisely
Letter to the better from the Brothers like Isley
Wisely to your bonce, alphabetical response

So can you hear it in our alpha?
We burn like sulphur-uric acid
Letters in my casket
Oesophagus, sarcophagus, we be fat as hippopotamus
Words I be creating be the size of a rhinoceros
Who be motormouth, Metal Mickey?
Audible barrage like Pat nagging Ricky
It's sticky, I got a mad glock in my flow
So duck out the fuck, "before I let go"

I'm not Reminton, I don't carry no steel
I rock the microphone to make the people then feel
The funk, so wave your arms like, uh, Nelly's trunk
Persist in fucking around, kid, you're going to get jumped
It's the word chucker
Lyric chucker, verb butter
Sticky freaky dickie undercover brother
When I drop my shit on the beat it melts your bonce
The stupid ponce's alphabetical response

Alphabetical Response

You're plastic like Wendy or should I say Cindy
With the grass skirt on, you do a fucking wicked shimmy
Sh-Sh-Shy-Shy's butt's on the key to the lock
He's the cappuccino of my brejin, Shy is the froth
Who turned your claat to stone like Medusa did the Kraken
We leave you in a pose to let your bastard know what happened
You boys still keep it up, I think I'll skank ya
We smash your word to shit because our grammar is the lick
So, A B C D E F U G
H, I be the one
Loading letters in my gun
Jaywalking
K L O, M no P Q balling
R S T for two-talking
U VW ex why you squawking?
You better check your A-Z and re-navigate your head
Or get a full frontal blow to your bonce
The Brotherhood flips the alphabetical response
